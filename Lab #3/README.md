In this lab, I loaded the Chocolate_Sales dataset into Jupyter Notebook using Pandas.
I checked the dataset’s shape to see how many rows and columns it contains, displayed the first few rows to preview the data, and examined the column names and data types using info().
I also reviewed the dataset structure to understand its contents before moving to further analysis.
